# Difference Between Min and Max of 3

### Required Skills Inventory

* Use variables to name, store, and retrieve values
* Write a method according to given specifications
* Write a method that takes arguments and returns a value
* Use parameter variables in a method body
* Write a return statement
* Use math operators to construct an expression
* Use an if statement to get the computer to make a decision

### Problem Description and Given Info

* Write a public static method named DiffMinMax that will take three arguments of type int and will return a int. 
* When called, and passed three int values, this method must compute and return the positive difference between the minimum and maximum of the three argument values.

Here are some examples of what the method should return for various sets of argument values:

    DiffMinMax(1, 2, 3)     should return 2

    DiffMinMax(50, 10, 20)  should return 40

    DiffMinMax(1, 1, 1)     should return 0

    DiffMinMax(50, 100, 10) should return 90

### Helpful Info:

* You will need to write code to determine the minimum and the maximum argument values passed to the method
* Do not use Math.min or Math.max methods for this assignment.
