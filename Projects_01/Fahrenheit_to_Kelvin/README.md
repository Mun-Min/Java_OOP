# Fahrenheit to Kelvin

### Required Skills Inventory

* Use variables to name, store, and retrieve values
* Use System.out.print to prompt the user for input
* Use a Scanner to collect user input
* Use math operators to construct expression
* Output to console with System.out.printf
* Use format specifiers to format floating point values
* Use escape sequences to include special characters in a String
* Write a method according to given specifications
* Write a method that takes arguments and returns a value
* Write a method that calls another method
* Use parameter variables in a method body
* Write a return statement
* Use math operators to construct an expression

### Problem Description and Given Info

Write a public static method named FahrenheitToKelvin:

* FahrenheitToKelvin will take a single argument of type double and will return a double. 
* When called, and passed a temperature value (in Fahrenheit), this method must compute and return the Kelvin temperature equivalent. 
* You must also write a small program in the main method that will prompt the user to enter a temperature value in Fahrenheit, collect and store the user's input in a double variable, call the FahrenheitToKelvin method, passing the user's input as an argument
store the value returned by the FahrenheitToKelvin method in another double variable
* Display the Kelvin equivalent value as shown in the Examples below

### Example Output

    Example 1:

    Enter temperature in Fahrenheit : 100

    100.00 degrees Fahrenheit is 310.93 Kelvin
    
    Example 2:

    Enter temperature in Fahrenheit : -20.25

    -20.25 degrees Fahrenheit is 244.12 Kelvin
    
    For the given inputs, make sure that your program output looks exactly like the examples above (including spelling, capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and decimal points).

### Helpful Info: Fahrenheit to Kelvin formula

    K = (F - 32) * 5 / 9 + 273.15

Remember that you can use System.out.printf to format your outputs so that they have the required number of decimal places
