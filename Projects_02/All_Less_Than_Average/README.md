# All Less Than Average

This program filters an ArrayList of integers and returns a new ArrayList containing only the elements that are less than the average of all the values in the input ArrayList.

### Required Skills Inventory

- Define and declare variables

- Create and use ArrayLists
- Write loops to iterate through an ArrayList
- Use conditional statements to filter elements
- Understand the `main` method and its role in Java programs
- Understand how to compile and run Java programs

### Problem Description and Given Info

The program consists of the following:

- The `lessThanAverage` method, which takes an ArrayList of integers as input and returns a new ArrayList containing elements that are less than the average of all the values in the input ArrayList.

- The `main` method, which provides examples and tests the `lessThanAverage` method with different inputs.

### Example Output

    Example 1

    Given: ArrayList with these values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    lessThanAverage(myList) should return an ArrayList with these values {1, 2}

    Example 2

    Given: ArrayList with these values {3, 7, 6, 2, 9, 0, 4, 8};

    lessThanAverage(myList) should return an ArrayList with these values {3, 2, 0, 4}

    Example 3

    Given: ArrayList with these values {1, 1, 1};

    lessThanAverage(myList) should return an ArrayList with these values { }
