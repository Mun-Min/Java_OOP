# Program Name: Count Greater Than Average

This program computes the count of values in an array that are greater than the average of all the values in the array.

### Required Skills Inventory

- Define and declare variables

- Create and use arrays
- Write loops to iterate through an array
- Use conditional statements to compare values
- Understand the `main` method and its role in Java programs
- Understand how to compile and run Java programs

### Problem Description and Given Info

The program consists of the following:

- The `main` method, which creates an array `myArray` with some values and calls the `countGreaterThanAverage` method, passing `myArray` as an argument. The result is then displayed on the console.

- The `countGreaterThanAverage` method, which takes an array of integers as input and returns the count of values in the array that are greater than the average of all the values.

### Example Output

```
Number of Values in the array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that are greater than the average of all the values in the array = 2
```

### Helpful Info

* You may want to write a `main` method to call and test your required method.

* There should be no `System.out.print` or `System.out.println` statements in your `countGreaterThanAverage` method.

* There should be no calls to any Scanner methods (like `next`, `nextLine`, or `nextInt`) in you `countGreaterThanAverage` method
