# Array Range Calculator

This program calculates the positive difference between the minimum and maximum values in a given array of integers.

### Required Skills Inventory

- Define and declare variables

- Create and use arrays
- Write loops to iterate through an array
- Use conditional statements
- Understand the `main` method and its role in Java programs
- Understand how to compile and run Java programs

### Problem Description and Given Info

The program consists of the following:

- The `main` method, which initializes an array `myArray` with some values and calls the `range` method, passing `myArray` as an argument. The result is then displayed on the console.

- The `range` method, which takes an array of integers as input and calculates the positive difference between the minimum and maximum values in the array. It returns the computed difference.

### Example Output

```
Difference between the maximum and minimum values in the argument array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = 4
```

### Helpful Info

* You may want to write a main method to call and test your `range` method.

* There should be no `System.out.print` or `System.out.println` statements in your `range` method.

* There should be no calls to any Scanner methods (like `next`, `nextLine`, or `nextInt`) in you `range` method

### Solution

* [Main.java](/Projects_02/Range/Main.java)
