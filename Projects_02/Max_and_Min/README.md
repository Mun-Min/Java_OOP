# Max and Min

This program finds the maximum and minimum values in a given array of integers.

### Required Skills Inventory

- Define and declare methods

- Use arrays to store and manipulate data
- Use loops to iterate over array elements
- Use conditional statements to compare values
- Use variables to store and update values
- Use the `System.out.println()` method to print output to the console
- Understand the `main` method and its role in Java programs
- Understand how to compile and run Java programs

### Problem Description and Given Info

The program includes the following:

- The `main` method, which initializes an array `myArray` with some values and calls the `maxAndMin` method to find the maximum and minimum values in the array.

- The `maxAndMin` method, which takes an array of integers as input and returns an array containing the maximum and minimum values.

## Example Output

The program will output the maximum and minimum values in the given array.

Example:
```
Max and Min Value of Array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}: 

{5, 1}
```

### Helpful Info:

- You may want to write a `main` method to call and test your required method

- There should be no `System.out.print` or `System.out.println` statements in your `maxAndMin` method
- There should be no calls to any Scanner methods (like `next`, `nextLine`, or `nextInt`) in you `maxAndMin` method
