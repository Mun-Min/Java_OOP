# Odd and Even

This program determines the count of odd and even numbers in a given array of integers.

### Required Skills Inventory

- Define and declare variables

- Create and use arrays
- Write loops to iterate through an array
- Use conditional statements to check for odd and even numbers
- Understand the `main` method and its role in Java programs
- Understand how to compile and run Java programs

### Problem Description and Given Info

The program consists of the following:

- The `main` method, which initializes an array `myArray` with some values and calls the `oddAndEven` method, passing `myArray` as an argument. The result is then displayed on the console.

- The `oddAndEven` method, which takes an array of integers as input and returns an array with two elements: the count of odd numbers and the count of even numbers in the given array.

### Example Output

```
Odd and Even value of Array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:

{2, 3}
```

### Helpful Info 

* You may want to write a main method to call and test your required method

* There should be no `System.out.print` or `System.out.println` statements in your oddAndEven method
* There should be no calls to any Scanner methods (like `next`, `nextLine`, or `nextInt`) in you `oddAndEven` method
* Zero is considered an even value
