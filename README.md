### Requirements

To run and experiment with the projects in this repository, ensure that you have the following:

Java Version: 

    openjdk 17.0.3

Utilizing Conda Environment for Java: 

    conda create -name myenv 

    conda activate myenv 

    conda install -c conda-forge openjdk

    If you intend to use Java with a specific IDE, such as Jupyter Notebook, you can install additional packages that enable Java support. 
    For example, install the ijava kernel for Jupyter Notebook:

    conda install -c conda-forge ijava

[Optional] Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for an enhanced development experience. However, using a plain text editor and command-line tools will also suffice.
