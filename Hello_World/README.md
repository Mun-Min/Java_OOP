Methodology. 

### Required Skills Inventory

* Define and declare classes

* Create and use objects of a class
* Write methods according to given specifications
* Write methods that take arguments and return values
* Use variables to name, store, and retrieve values
* Use parameter variables in a method body
* Write a return statement
* Use the `System.out.println()` method to print output to the console
* Utilize object-oriented programming (OOP) methodology
* Understand the concept of classes and objects
* Understand the `main` method and its role in Java programs
* Understand how to compile and run Java programs

### Problem Description and Given Info

* Write a public method named `sayHello` that will print the output to the console

### Example Output 

    $ java Main

    Hello World!
    I am learning how to do Object-Oriented-Programming in Java!

### Helpful Info:

* You will need to create two seperate files, one file that will have your function for generating output and one file that will call those functions and display the results 

* Challenge yourself and add your own functions to practice the basics of OOP
